Project Overview:

This project exemplifies data engineering processes, showcasing adeptness in data handling. 
By engineering Zillow CSV files and utilizing API calls, a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline was implemented to meticulously clean, edit, and upload the data to a SQL database. 
Comprehensive comparisons were conducted, contrasting Chicago-specific data with major US cities and within the Chicago area itself. 
This expansive dataset fosters nuanced analyses, providing insights into historical changes within specific regions and enabling cross-regional comparisons. 
It serves as a valuable asset for exploring trends in real estate markets, assessing demographic shifts, and evaluating urban development trajectories.
